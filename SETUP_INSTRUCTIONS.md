# PollMaster Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Now that your database schema is set up, follow these steps to get your poll creation functionality working:

## 1. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
```

### How to get these values:

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
4. Copy the values:
   - **Project URL** â†’ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** â†’ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role secret** â†’ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 2. Test the Setup

### Step 1: Start your development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the create poll page
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/polls/create`
- Make sure you're logged in (the form requires authentication)

### Step 3: Create a test poll
- Fill out the form with test data
- Submit the form
- Check the browser console for any errors

## 3. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "You must be logged in to create a poll"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in through the authentication system
- Check if your AuthContext is properly set up

#### Database connection errors
- **Solution**: Verify your environment variables are correct
- Check that the Supabase project is active
- Ensure the database schema was run successfully

#### RLS Policy errors
- **Solution**: Make sure Row Level Security is enabled
- Verify the RLS policies were created in the schema

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network tab** for failed API requests
3. **Verify Supabase logs** in your project dashboard
4. **Test database connection** with a simple query

## 4. What's Working Now

âœ… **Database Schema**: Tables, RLS policies, and functions are created
âœ… **TypeScript Types**: Full type safety for database operations
âœ… **Server Actions**: Server-side functions for poll operations
âœ… **Form Component**: Enhanced form with validation and error handling
âœ… **Authentication Integration**: Form checks for user login status

## 5. Next Steps

After confirming poll creation works:

1. **Test poll listing** - Update the polls page to show real data
2. **Add voting functionality** - Implement the vote submission
3. **Create poll detail pages** - Show individual polls with results
4. **Add QR code sharing** - Generate shareable QR codes for polls

## 6. Testing the Database

You can test your database connection by running this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('polls', 'poll_options', 'votes');

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('polls', 'poll_options', 'votes');

-- Check if policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('polls', 'poll_options', 'votes');
```

## 7. Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure the database schema ran successfully
4. Check Supabase project logs for server-side errors

The poll creation functionality should now be fully working with your Supabase database! ðŸŽ‰
